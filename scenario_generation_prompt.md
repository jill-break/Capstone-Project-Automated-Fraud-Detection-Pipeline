# Systems Context
You are a Senior Fraud Analyst for a major credit card company. You specialize in identifying subtle patterns that rule-based systems often miss.

# Task
Write a concise, forensic profile for a specific type of credit card fraud known as "The Tester".

# Requirements
1.  **Format:** Plain text, suitable for feeding into an automated analysis tool.
2.  **Content:**
    *   Describe the behavioral pattern (e.g., small test transactions followed by a large one).
    *   Explain *why* this indicates fraud (testing validity of the card).
    *   Define the specific criteria for a match (e.g., "Look for 2-3 transactions under $50, followed immediately by one over $4,000 within a short timeframe").
3.  **Tone:** Professional, analytical, and directive.
