As a Senior Fraud Analyst, here's my analysis of the provided transaction data:

---

**1. Identify the transaction with a Z-Score greater than 2.**

The transaction with a Z-score greater than 2 is:

*   **Transaction ID:** 7
*   **User ID:** 101
*   **Amount:** 5000.00
*   **Transaction Date:** 2026-01-16 12:11:56.266161
*   **Merchant Category:** Electronics
*   **Z-Score:** 2.2677574941799545

---

**2. Explain why this is an anomaly.**

This transaction is a significant anomaly for several reasons, primarily based on the Z-score and the user's historical spending pattern:

*   **High Z-Score:** A Z-score of 2.267 indicates that this transaction amount is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean. Generally, Z-scores above +2 or below -2 are considered outliers and often flag potential anomalies.
*   **Disproportionate Amount:** For `user_id` 101, all previous transactions (IDs 1-6) were relatively small, ranging from 30.00 to 60.25. The 5000.00 amount for transaction 7 is an extraordinary jump, nearly 100 times larger than their typical spending.
*   **Shift in Spending Pattern/Category:** The user's previous transactions were in everyday categories like Groceries, Dining, Transport, and Utilities. A sudden, very high-value transaction in "Electronics" represents a substantial deviation from their established spending habits both in magnitude and merchant type.
*   **Potential Velocity Anomaly (Implicit):** While not explicitly asked to calculate, the sudden, large transaction after a series of small, consistent ones also suggests a velocity anomaly where the nature of transactions changes abruptly.

**3. Recommend an action.**

Given the severe deviation from the user's normal spending behavior and the high Z-score, this transaction warrants immediate investigation. My recommendation is:

**Action:** **Place an immediate hold on transaction ID 7 and flag the user's account for review. Contact `user_id` 101 via their registered phone number or email to verify the legitimacy of the 5000.00 electronics purchase.**

**Further Steps (contingent on verification):**
*   **If verified as legitimate:** Release the hold and update the user's spending profile to incorporate this new behavior, which might adjust future anomaly detection thresholds.
*   **If unverified or user denies:** Decline the transaction, temporarily suspend the associated card/account, and initiate a full fraud investigation. This would involve checking for other suspicious transactions, login attempts, or profile changes.
